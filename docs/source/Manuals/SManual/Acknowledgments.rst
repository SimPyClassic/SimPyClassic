SimPy |release| has been primarily developed by Stefan Scherfke and  Ontje Lünsdorf,
starting from SimPy 1.9. Their work has  resulted in a most elegant combination
of an object oriented API with the existing API, maintaining full backward
compatibility.  It has been quite easy to integrate their product into the
existing SimPy code and documentation environment.

Thanks, guys, for this great job! **SimPy 2.0 is dedicated to you!**

The many contributions of the SimPy user and developer communities are of
course also gratefully acknowledged.
