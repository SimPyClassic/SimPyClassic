Short Manual for SimPy Classic
=================================
SimPy Classic is a free, open-source discrete-event simulation system written
in Python. It provides a number of tools for programmers writing
simulation programs. This document is a description of basic
techniques of SimPy. It describes a subset of SimPy's capabilities -
sufficient, we think, to develop standard simulations. You may also
find The Bank tutorial included in SimPy's distribution helpful in
the early stages.  The full SimPy Classic Manual, included in the distribution, is
more detailed.

You need to write Python code to develop a SimPy Classic model. In
particular, you will have to define and use classes and their
objects. Python is free and open-source and is available on most
platforms.  You can find out more about it and download it from the
`Python web-site`_ where there is full documentation and
tutorials. SimPy requires Python version 2.3 or later.
