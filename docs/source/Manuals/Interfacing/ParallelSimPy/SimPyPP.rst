Running SimPy on Multiple Processors with **Parallel Python**

Introduction
=============

With SimPy 2.0, you can easily increase the performance of your simulation by
using `Parallel Python`_ if you have a larger number of independent processors
(multiple CPUs or cores). *Parallel Python* can distribute the execution of
your SimPy processes to all cores of your CPU and even to other computers. You
should read the PP documentation for further information on how this works.

.. _`Parallel Python`: http://www.parallelpython.com/

Please, note that *Parallel Python* is not included in the SimPy  distribution
and needs to be `downloaded <http://www.parallelpython.com/>` and installed
separately.

Examples
=============

Example #1
-----------------

The files PPExample.txt_ and PPExampleProcess.txt_ contain a small example
with several car processes. It is important, that processes etc.are not
defined in the file that starts the PP job server and executes the jobs,
since ``ppserver.submit()`` only takes functions defined in the same file and
module names to import, but no classes.

PPExample.py::

    """
    Example for SimPy with Parallel Python.
    """

    import PPExampleProcess
    from SimPy.Simulation import *
    import pp


    def runSimulation(jobNum, numCars):
        sim = SimPy.Simulation.Simulation()
        cars = []
        for i in range(numCars):
            car = PPExampleProcess.Car(sim, i * jobNum + i)
            sim.activate(car, car.run(), at = 0)
            cars.append(car)
        sim.simulate(until = 30)


    server = pp.Server(ppservers = ())
    for i in range(4):
        job = server.submit(
                            runSimulation,
                            (i, 2),
                            (),
                            ('SimPy.Simulation', 'PPExampleProcess'))
        job()

PPExampleProcess.py::

    from SimPy.Simulation import *

    class Car(Process):

        def __init__(self, sim, id):
            Process.__init__(self, sim = sim)
            self.id = id

        def run(self):
            while True:
                yield hold, self, 10
                print 'Car #%i at t = %i' % (self.id, self.sim.now())

.. _PPExample.txt: ../../../_static/PPExample.txt
.. _PPExampleProcess.txt: ../../../_static/PPExampleProcess.txt

The simulated process in this case is a simple car, that holds for ten steps
and then prints the current simulation time. Obviously, each car process is
independent from the other ones. Thus if we want to simulate a great number of
cars, we can easily distribute the processes to many CPU cores and others
computers in our network.

PP pickles everything it sends to other cores/computers. Since SimPy is
currently not pickleable, you cannot submit ``Simulation.simulate()`` to the
PPServer. In this example ``runSimulation`` is defined and submitted to the
server. The code within it will be executed on each core/computer. In the
example we create four simulation jobs with two cars for each job.

Run PPExample.py to execute the example.

Example #2
------------

Files simulator.txt_ and processes.txt_ contain an example that
simulates refrigerators in single-thread and in parallel simulation mode.

Class ``Simulator`` simulates a number of fridges and gets the resulting data.

Class ``ParallelSimulator`` simulates a number of fridges and gets the resulting data.
A number of jobs will be created that use all available
CPU cores or even other computers.

To use clustering, ParallelPython needs to be installed on all computers
and the server demon "ppserver.py" must be started. The list of the servers'
IP addresses must then be passed to the constructor of this class.

Run ``simulator.py`` to execute this example.
