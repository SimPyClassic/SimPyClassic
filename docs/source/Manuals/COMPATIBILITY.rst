COMPATIBILITY: SimPy
====================

SimPy has been used successfully with many packages and modules, such as
Tk/Tkinter for GUIs and VPython and matplotlib for graphical output.

The design of SimPy is such that no incompatibilities with Python 2.7 through
3.6 modules or Python 2.7 through 3.6-accessible packages are expected.

SimPy |release| has been tested with Python 2.7, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6. On Linux and
Windows 10.

Should SimPy users discover any incompatibilities, the authors would be
grateful for a report. Just send a message with the problem  and its context
to: simpy-users@lists.sourceforge.net.
