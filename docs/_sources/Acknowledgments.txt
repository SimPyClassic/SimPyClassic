SimPy 2.1 is a great refactoring of SimPy 2.0. 
It has been primarily developed by  
Ontje L |uumlaut| nsdorf, with key inputs by Stefan Scherfke.
SimPy now offers much better capabilities for writing debugger code. 
It is also easier to maintain, as the code base has been significantly
reduced.

Thanks, guys, for this great job! You have become a major force in SimPy's
evolution.
