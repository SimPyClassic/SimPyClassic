SimPy has been used successfully with many packages and modules, such as
Tk/Tkinter for GUIs and VPython and matplotlib for graphical output.

The design of SimPy is such that no incompatibilities with Python 2.3 through 
2.5 modules or Python 2.3 through 2.5-accessible packages are expected.

SimPy 1.9 has been tested with Python 2.3, 2.4 and 2.5.

All SimPy scripts (with the exception of the ones depending on Tkinter) work
under IronPython 1, after the removal of the shebang line.

Should SimPy users discover any incompatibilities, the authors would
be grateful for a report. Just send a message with the problem 
and its context to: simpy-users@lists.sourceforge.net.
