SimPy has been used successfully with many packages and modules, such as
Tk/Tkinter for GUIs and VPython and matplotlib for graphical output.

The design of SimPy is such that no incompatibilities with Python 2.3 through 
2.6 modules or Python 2.3 through 2.6-accessible packages are expected.

SimPy 2.0 has been tested with Python 2.3, 2.4, 2.5 and 2.6.

Should SimPy users discover any incompatibilities, the authors would
be grateful for a report. Just send a message with the problem 
and its context to: simpy-users@lists.sourceforge.net.
