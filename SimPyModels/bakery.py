Scenario:
The Patisserie Francaise bakery has three ovens baking their renowned
baguettes for retail and restaurant customers. They start baking one
hour before the shop opens and stop at closing time. 
They bake batches of 40 breads at a time,
taking 25..30 minutes (uniformly distributed) per batch. Retail customers
arrive at a rate of 40 per hour (exponentially distributed). They buy
1, 2 or 3 baguettes with equal probability. Restaurant buyers arrive
at a rate of 4 per hour (exponentially dist.). They buy 20,40 or 60
baguettes with equal probability.
Simulate this operation for 100 days of 8 hours shop opening time.
a) What is the mean waiting time for retail and restaurant buyers?
b) What is their maximum waiting time?
b) What percentage of customer has to wait longer than 15 minutes??
c) Plot the number of baguettes over time for an arbitrary day.
   (use PLOTTING=True to do this)
