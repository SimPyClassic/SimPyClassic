  Queue with blocked customers cleared
  Jobs (e.g messages) arrive randomly at rate 1.0 per minute at a
  2-server system.  Mean service time is 0.75 minutes and the
  service-time distribution is (1) exponential, (2) Erlang-5, or (3)
  hyperexponential with p=1/8,m1=2.0, and m2=4/7. However no
  queue is allowed; a job arriving when all the servers are busy is
  rejected.
  
  Develop and run a simulation program to estimate the probability of
  rejection (which, in steady-state, is the same as p(c)) Measure
  and compare the probability for each service time distribution.
  Though you should test the program with a trace, running just a few
  jobs, the final runs should be of 10000 jobs without a trace. Stop
  the simulation when 10000 jobs have been generated.
