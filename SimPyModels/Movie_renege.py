"""
Movie_renege

Demo program to show event-based reneging by 
'yield (request,self,res),(waitevent,self,evt)'.

Scenario:
A movie theatre has one ticket counter selling tickets for 
three movies (next show only). When a movie is sold out, all
people waiting to buy ticket for that movie renege (leave queue).
