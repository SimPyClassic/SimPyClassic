""" centralserver.py

A time-shared computer consists of a single
central processing unit (CPU) and a number of
terminals. The operator of each terminal `thinks'
for a time (exponential, mean 100.0 sec) and then
submits a task to the computer with a service time
(exponential, mean 1.0 sec). The operator then
remains idle until the task completes service and
returns to him or her. The arriving tasks form a
single FCFS queue in front of the CPU.

Upon leaving the CPU a task is either finished
(probability 0.20) and returns to its operator
to begin another `think' time, or requires data
from a disk drive (probability 0.8). If a task
requires access to the disk, it joins a FCFS queue
before service (service time at the disk,
exponential, mean 1.39 sec). When finished with
the disk, a task returns to the CPU queue again
for another compute time (exp, mean 1.$ sec).

the objective is to measure the throughput of
the CPU (tasks per second)
