This file describes the installation of SimPy 1.9.

In order to install SimPy on your system, you will need to perform the
following steps:

1. Check that you have Python 2.3 or a later version installed on your
   system. If necessary, download it from http://www.python.org and
   install it.

2. Download and unpack the SimPy archive into a folder (using option "Use folder
   names" in WinZip, "Re-create folders" in Linux Archive Manager, or
   similar option in your unpacker). This will create a SimPy-1.9 folder with all source
   code and documentation.	Run "python setup.py install" in that folder. This 
   will install the SimPy programs in a folder on the Python 
   search path (typically /Lib/site-packages). 

3. Run one or more of the programs under /SimPy-1.9/SimPyModels to see
   whether Python finds the SimPy module. If you get an error message
   like "ImportError: No module named SimPy", move the SimPy folder
   into a directory which you know to be on the Python module search
   path (like /Lib/site-packages).

4. Read the tutorial and manuals and build your own simple models. A
   few lines of Python with SimPy calls can already model significant
   real systems.

Enjoy simulation programming in SimPy!
